Scripts used in the paper about "The Relationship between Soil Microbiome Diversity and Chemical Properties" 
1. Joining former and reverse reads together: Joining paired ends
2. Splitting the libraries according to the barcodes generated from joining paired ends: Demultiplexing
3. Picking OTUs with 97% of similarity as the threshold, closed reference used: Picking OTUs_closed reference
4. Core diversity analyses to generate data: Core diversity analyses
5. Compare whether there is statistically significant difference between samples for different chemical property levels using ANOSIM test: Compare categories for nitrogen level, for phosphorus level, for pH values and for potassium level
6. Plot 2D PCoA graphs in the distance matrix to compare the dissimilarities: Plot 2D PCoA graphs
7. Filtering the Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria from the OTU table: Filter taxonomy from OTU table
8. Plot 2D PCoA graphs in the distance matrix to compare the dissimilarities after filtering: Plot 2D PCoA graphs after filtering taxonomy
9. Compare OTU frequencies between samples to see if there is statistically significant difference using non-parametric ANOVA: Group significance (K), (N), (P), (pH)
